# Mini-Twitter
In this project we implemented a social network server and client. The client was implemented in C++ and the server in Java. 
The implementation of the server is based on the Thread-Per-Client (TPC) and Reactor servers, both implemented in the project.
The communication between the server and the clients performed using a binary communication protocol. A registered user was able to 
login\logout, follow\unfollow other users, post messages, and send private messages to other registered users.
